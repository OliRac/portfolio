    "description": "Fresh Computer Science graduate. Looking to take my first step in the software development industry, whether in web, mobile, corporate or games. Started off in IT for the City of Westmount, but instead of doing support work, I was tasked with front-end development and creating small programs to make the departmentâ€™s employee's lives easier. This provided motivation to pursue an education in Computer Science, deviating from IT / support."
